# Cafe-Api
An API designed using REST api architecture with routes created for user to "get" data about cafes in their geographical area through the API in a json format and also make "post"  requests to the database through the API. 

• templates: Contains html files that would be dynamically rendered using flask.

• main.py: Using the REST api architecture, it contains specific routes that returns data based on the request method assigned to the route. For example, the /edit route makes use of the POST request method to edit a specific cafe data in the database. 

• cafe.db: This is the database that contains all the cafe data. 

• Postman application was used to test that all the routes worked as they were supposed to and also to create the API documentation.
